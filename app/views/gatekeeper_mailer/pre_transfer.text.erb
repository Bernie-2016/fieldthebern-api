Coming soon: New login system for Bernie 2016

Hello! Thank you so much for helping to canvass across the United States with the Field the Bern
 app! Your work is key to winning this campaign. In order to make your work easier, a new service is
 being created, and it's called Gatekeeper. Gatekeeper is a single sign on (a.k.a. SSO for the techies
 out there). Starting with the Field the Bern, Gatekeeper will allow volunteers to use a single email
and password across all Bernie 2016 applications. Stay tuned for more applications that will be using
 this new and exciting service!

Thanks so much for your work,
The “Field the Bern” team
